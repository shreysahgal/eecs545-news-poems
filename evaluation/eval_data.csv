0,1337,"The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that state law barred local governments from enacting ordinances banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but justices did not address the law's constitutionality. The unanimous decision voided anti-discrimination protections passed in 2015 in Fayetteville, a liberal city that is home to the state's flagship university, as well as similar ordinances adopted by other local governments in the politically conservative state. State Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a Republican, had appealed a lower court ruling upholding the Fayetteville ordinance, which prohibited discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in employment, hiring and other aspects of commerce. Rutledge cited an Arkansas law forbidding cities and counties from extending nondiscrimination protections beyond those classes identified at the state level. The legislature passed that measure in 2015 after initial attempts by Fayetteville to enact an anti-discrimination ordinance failed.-Fayetteville and several other cities then passed ordinances in response to state law. Although other state statutes against bullying and spousal abuse include gender identity and sexual orientation, the Arkansas civil rights code makes no mention of either. In siding with Rutledge, the Supreme Court held that the state civil rights law was the controlling statute.-The court said Fayetteville's city ordinance could not stand because it created a direct inconsistency between state and municipal law. Left undecided was whether the underlying state law passed constitutional muster. The court returned that issue to the local trial judge for consideration. Rutledge said she was grateful for the ruling, noting that Arkansas""?law required ""discrimination protection be addressed at the state level and be uniform throughout the state.""?LGBT advocates, who argue the state law banning local protections for gay and transgender people is discriminatory, said they were disappointed. ""We would have preferred to have a final outcome today, but I'm certain there will be further appellate review after the trial court rehears the case,""?said Holly Dickson, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union at Little Rock. The ACLU filed a brief in support of the Fayetteville ordinance. (Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Leslie Adler) Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post? Here's how.

1,1815,"China is showing no signs of stepping back from its vehement opposition to the deployment of the US Army's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, despite Seoul's efforts to convince Beijing that it is designed purely to protect South Korean citizens from a belligerent and nuclear-armed regime in Pyongyang. Beijing has reiterated its anger at the proposed deployment of a THAAD battery since a member company of the Seoul-based Lotte Group recently confirmed that it had reached agreement to provide a golf course in Seongju County as the base for the system. South Korea's Ministry of National Defense announced on Tuesday, February 28, that it was taking control of the site for the battery. Within a few hours, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry addressed a news conference, saying Beijing ""is firmly opposed to and strongly dissatisfied with"" Seoul cooperating with the United States to bring forward the deployment of the THAAD battery and ""ignoring China's interests and concerns."" Veiled threats In a thinly veiled threat, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China will ""resolutely take necessary actions to safeguard its own security interests."" Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2XVeC That theme was continued by state-run media, with The Global Times quoting Song Zhongping, a former officer in the People's Liberation Army, as saying that once THAAD is deployed, ""Seongju County will appear on the list of the PLA's missile system's strike targets."" A more immediate threat comes in the form of suggestions that Beijing is going to make business life difficult for the Lotte Group in China, stepping up a campaign that has so far targeted South Korean music and entertainment groups performing in China. South Korean airlines were also refused permission to operate additional flights over the busy Chinese New Year period. And analysts say that should South Korea continue to push ahead with the deployment of THAAD, then more companies may find it increasingly difficult to operate in China. ""They do have a track record of putting pressure on South Korea ever since the plan to deploy THAAD was first announced last year,"" said Stephen Nagy, an associate professor of international relations at Tokyo's International Christian University. US Defense Secretary James Mattis has warned Pyongyang that any nuclear attack by N. Korea would trigger an ""effective"" response. But how is China looking at the Trump administration's aggressive stance towards its ally? (03.02.2017) North Korea's military has said it will make a ""physical response"" to the US and South Korea's decision to deploy the advanced THAAD missile defense system on the Korean peninsula. Beijing is not best pleased either. (11.07.2016) The new US defense secretary has soothed concerns that the Trump administration would turn its back on South Korea. The two countries plan to move forward on the installment the THAAD missile defense system. (03.02.2017) The two neighbors and long-time rivals have taken steps to ease the pain of the past, although many in Korea have a long memory of their mistreatment at the hands of Japanese colonizers. Julian Ryall reports from Tokyo. (01.09.2016) ""A number of cultural presentations in China have been cancelled, authorities have stepped up investigations into Korean companies in China and it seems that the next step will be to put additional pressure on Lotte's operations there,"" he told DW. Power over the public The government's control of the media also gives it power over the Chinese public, the expert noted, pointing to an editorial in The Global Times that declared ""Chinese consumers should become the main force in teaching Seoul a lesson, punishing the nation through the power of the market."" And the impact has been swift; Lotte's Chinese-language website was disrupted on Tuesday by unidentified hackers, while protesters outside a Lotte mall in Jilin Province, northeast China, displayed a placard that read, ""Lotte has issued a declaration of war against China and Lotte should leave China right now."" ""Chinese people will support whatever the government tells them,"" said Nagy. ""There has been an upsurge in nationalist rhetoric on the Weibo and WeChat social media sites and this sort of tactic can have a serious economic impact on Lotte and South Korea."" Daniel Pinkston, a professor of international relations at the Seoul campus of Troy University, agrees that the economic fallout for South Korea could be serious as nearly 30 percent of Korean exports are to China. But, he told DW, the national security threat that South Korea faces ""trumps that several times over because having a good business in China is no help at all if you are targeted by a North Korean nuclear missile."" Seoul and Washington have repeatedly explained to the Chinese government that THAAD is purely a defensive system, although Beijing insists that its powerful radar will be able to peer into Chinese territory and will alter the security balance in East Asia. Claims are 'absurd' ""I believe China has some minor legitimate concerns, but they are being exaggerated,"" Pinkston said. ""Chinese officials and the media there frequently and repeatedly misrepresent the issue as opposed to addressing minor technical issues. Really, for China, this is about the regional security architecture of the US and its allies in the region, primarily South Korea and Japan, and the US military presence in both those countries. ""China's ICBMs are not launched from that part of the country so for them to claim that THAAD is a threat is nonsense,"" he argued. ""Equally, reports that you see in their media that this is some 'precursor to a plot to wage war on China' is simply absurd."" Pinkston said his contacts in the South Korean government have expressed both concern and bewilderment at the stance being adopted by China - which has made it clear in the past that it would not rush to South Korea's assistance if the nation was ever threatened. ""It's surprising to watch,"" he said. ""China is taking more measures and encouraging more rhetoric among its own people against a country that wants to deploy a defensive system than it has against North Korea, which is keeping up a steady routine of missile tests and nuclear tests close to the Chinese border. ""What would they do in similar circumstances?"" Pinkston asked. ""What do they really expect South Korea to do?"" -",China targets South Korean business in row over missile defense,"start china is like business reservation

3,3599,"In the formal letter that notified the European Union of Britain's intention to leave, May warned that the failure to strike a deal on any future relationship would have consequences for security. ""In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened,"" she wrote in the letter. In all, May mentioned security 11 times in the six-page letter. 'Shameful threat' Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who oppose Brexit, said her link between trade and security was ""shameful"" and a ""blatant threat."" ""Security is too important to be used as a bargaining chip and this will backfire in any negotiations, which rather than building up alliances will leave Britain even more isolated,"" he said. Labour MP Yvette Cooper echoed the concerns. ""Completely irresponsible to threaten, gamble or bargain on national security,"" she wrote on Twitter. Speaking in the Commons, Stephen Kinnock of the opposition Labour Party read out an excerpt from the letter and asked, ""Is she really saying the security of our country will be traded like a bargaining chip in these negotiations?"" May replied that it would be important to negotiate a future deal on security. ""We have a relationship with the European Union, there are certain elements of the European Union in justice and home affairs that we're currently members of that in leaving the European Union we would not be members of, and we need to negotiate what the future relationship will be. ""It's very simple, it's very pragmatic and the aim of this will be to ensure cooperation on these matters."" Britain is a member of Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, which co-ordinates the sharing of intelligence on terrorism and organized crime between member states. It is also arguably the union's strongest defense power, according to the Institute for Government. ""It is one of only two member states possessing 'full-spectrum' military capabilities (including a nuclear deterrent) and one of only five spending 2% of GDP on defense. It also holds a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and has the largest military budget within the EU,"" the institute said. A Downing Street spokesman declined to expand on the letter. ""The Prime Minister's words speak for themselves. It's a simple fact that if we leave the EU without a deal, the arrangements which we have as part of our EU membership will lapse,"" he told CNN. Trade deal sought The official start to the Brexit process came nine months after the UK voted in a hotly contested referendum that exposed deep divisions across the country. In her letter, May said the UK wanted to pursue a ""bold and ambitions"" free-trade agreement with the EU in forthcoming talks. If the country fails to strike a trade deal with Britain and defaults to trading under World trade Organization rules, it is forecast to lose 7.5% of its GDP over 15 years, according to the UK's own official estimates. May has made clear that the country will not remain in the bloc's single market or customs union, which essentially make the EU a free-trade zone. Staying in the market would likely have forced Britain to keep its borders open to all EU citizens, a key argument by the Leave campaign to exit the union. In her letter, May tried to strike a conciliatory tone with the EU, reiterating her hopes for Britain and the union to remain the closest of allies and to seek a ""deep and special partnership."" She also made clear that she wanted to avoid walking away with no deal, and proposed several principles to guide negotiations. Here are the letter's highlights: The UK won't seek membership of the single market, essentially a free-trade zone. But it will seek a 'bold and ambitious' free-trade agreement. The UK hopes to avoid a cliff-edge separation and ensure certainty for businesses. It warns that European security will be under threat if a deal is not reached. It expects the devolved regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be granted greater powers. The government aims to repeal EU laws and automatically adopt them into UK law for review. A White Paper on how to do this will be published Thursday. Tusk: 'We already miss you' May accepted there would be downsides of Brexit. ""We understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU,"" she told MPs. ""We know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy. We know that UK companies that trade with the EU will have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part, just as we do in other overseas markets. We accept that."" After receiving the Article 50 letter, Tusk struck a gloomy note. ""There is no reason to pretend that this is a happy day, neither in Brussels nor in London. After all, most Europeans, - including almost half the British voters, wished that we would stay together, not drift apart. As for me, I will not pretend that I am happy today,"" Tusk said. But he added that Brexit had made the 27 other nations in the EU more determined and united. ""And what can I add to this? We already miss you.""",Theresa May accused of 'blatant threat' against EU on security,"uk chief calls for situation

4,2085,"Abdellatif Merdas, a-Moroccan member of parliament, has been shot dead in Casablanca, according to police. - The 53-year-old, a politician with the liberal Constitutional Union party,-was gunned down late on Tuesday near his home in the well-off southern district of Californie. His assassins fled the scene, but police said on Wednesday they had arrested a 27-year-old man suspected of links to the assault.- A raid on the suspect's home came up with two shotguns similar to the one used in the attack, police said. The assault is believed to be criminally motivated. Initial investigations suggest that the suspect had previously threatened Merdas with death due to alleged personal differences, police said. Merdas, who represented the Ben Ahmed district 60km south of the coastal city of Casablanca,-was in his official car when he was hit three times by shotgun fire, private news websites reported. Hit in the head, he succumbed to his wouds shortly afterwards. Local news websites showed photos of the scene and a car with broken windows, surrounded by police officers.

5,1111,"President Donald Trump said reports that members of his campaign team had multiple contacts with Russian officials during his presidential campaign are ""fake news"" and called the storyline ""fabricated"" by those bitter over Hillary Clinton's election loss. ""It's all fake news,""?Trump told reporters at a press conference in the East Room of the White House on Thursday, calling the matter a ""Habricated deal to make up for the loss of the Democrats.""?The president's remarks came after The New York Times reported this week that members of Trump's campaign had multiple contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sources told ABC News that Trump associates had contact with suspected Russian intelligence officials in the lead-up to the election. Though the president refuted the reporting as fake news, he told ABC News' Jonathan Karl that suspected leaks coming from inside the government are real. ""Well, the leaks are real. You are the one that wrote about them and reported them. The leaks are real. You know what they said. You saw it. And the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake,"" Trump said. He has instructed the Justice Department to look into the suspected leaks, which he has called ""illegal."" Congressional Republicans have also called for the DOJ inspector general to look into the potential mishandling of classified information within the law enforcement agency. When another reporter followed up to ask if any members of Trump's campaign had contacts with Russian officials, the president said definitively that he was not aware of any such contacts. ""No, no, nobody that I know of,"" Trump said. He went on to say that neither he nor his former campaign manager Pual Manafort had contact with Russia. ""Look, how many times do I have to answer this question? Russia is a ruse,"" the president said. ""I have nothing to do with Russia. No person that I deal with does. Manafort totally denied it.

6,1430,"Donald Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, pounced on the media during the Conservative Political Action Conference Thursday, repeating his attack that the press is the ""opposition party"" that is ""always wrong"" about the administration. ""I think if you look at, you know, the opposition party,"" said Bannon, referring to the media, during his appearance at the conference with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. ""How they portrayed the campaign, how they portrayed the transition and how they're portraying the administration -- it's always wrong."" Bannon, who once was the head of the conservative outlet Breitbart News, took issue with descriptions of the White House as ""chaotic,"" ""disorganized"" and ""unprofessional,"" saying that the same terms were used against the ultimately-victorious campaign. Now, with Trump as president, both Bannon and Priebus made the argument that he is following through on his promises, despite distractions.     ""All President Trump does every day is hit his agenda every single day, whether it's TPP, deregulation, Neil Gorsuch, his promise is coming through every day,""?Priebus said. ""[Everything] he's doing is laid out an agenda with the speeches on the promises he made and our job is get the paths of what he's executed, and he is maniacally focused on that,""?Bannon added. The setting of the conversation -- CPAC -- was a foreign one for Bannon. In past years, Breitbart sponsored discussions that ran counter to the event, called ""The Uninvited."" The chief strategist poked fun at his attendance at the main event Thursday. ""I want to thank you for finally inviting me to CPAC,""?said Bannon, who portrayed his appearance at the convention, and his working relationship with Priebus, as the marriage of conservatism and the Republican party establishment. Priebus, the former chair of the Republican National Committee, joined in on the media criticism when it came to his relationship with Bannon, which a number of outlets, including Breitbart, have classified as rocky. ""In regard to us two, I think the biggest misconception is everything that you're reading,"" said Priebus.
